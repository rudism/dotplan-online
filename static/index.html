    <h2>What is Dotplan?</h2>
    <p>Dotplan is a modern re-imagining of the <a href='https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/122782/what-is-plan-for-users'>Plan</a> file from the days of yesteryear. Well, I mean technically it's still around today, but when was the last time you <code>finger</code>ed someone?</p>
    <p>On second thought, never mind. Don't answer that...</p>
    <p>Essentially it's a loosey-goosey API specification through which the technically elite can express their personalities (or lack thereof) with one another.</p>
    <h2>What is Dotplan Online?</h2>
    <p>This site is a free Dotplan provider and relay running the <a href='https://github.com/rudism/dotplan-online'>Dotplan reference implementation</a>. If you're some kind of simpleton who is incapable of hosting your own, you can point your email domain here via a <code>SRV</code> record and use it as your Dotplan provider.</p>
